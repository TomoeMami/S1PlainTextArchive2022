 <blockquote>The House passed legislation Wednesday that would force a tentative rail labor agreement and thwart a national strike. The bill now goes to the Senate, where Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has promised swift passage.

The House voted 290 to 137 — with 79 Republicans joining 211 Democrats — to pass the legislation, which approves new contracts providing railroad workers with 24% pay increases over five years from 2020 through 2024, immediate payouts averaging $11,000 upon ratification, and an extra paid day off.

Eight Democrats and 129 Republicans voted against the legislation. 

In a separate 221 to 207 vote, the House also approved a resolution to provide seven days of paid sick leave in the contract instead of one, which is rail workers’ main disagreement with the current deal. As it stands rail workers don’t have guaranteed paid sick leave.</blockquote>

 <blockquote>What would happen in a shutdown? 

In addition to rattling commutes and spoiling cross-country travel for thousands of Americans, a walkout could deal a major blow to the economy. A strike would shut down nearly a third of the country’s freight, industry players have warned.

A freight railroad shutdown could “devastate” Amtrak operations, according to the Association of American Railroads. About half of commuter rail systems run at least partially on tracks or rights of way owned by freight railroads.

A stoppage also would have significant implications for retailers, which rely on freight rails to transport inventory from ports to warehouses and distribution centers. Such a scenario could have a domino effect — retailers would miss their shipping and pickup dates, leaving cargo in limbo without a place to go, according to Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chains and customs policy at the National Retail Federation.

“It adds to the ongoing congestion that we’re facing within the supply chain,” he said. “And that all adds additional costs that folks haven’t planned for.”

While scrambling to strike a deal, the Biden administration was pursuing contingency plans to ensure key products carried by rail — including food, energy and health products — would reach their final destinations.</blockquote>
众议院刚通过法案意在促成劳资双方达成一致，并阻止铁路工会在12月份再次**不做

[https://xueqiu.com/1107854878/230609210](https://xueqiu.com/1107854878/230609210) <blockquote>美国或于本周五迎来30年来首次全国性铁路**，这可能加剧当地供应链短缺及能源危机。

美国货运铁路运营商周一已经停止接收危险和其他安全敏感材料，为周五可能的大**提前做准备。与铁路运营商谈判的两大工会（BLET、SMART）已明确表态，除非在合同中加入更多改善生活质量的待遇条款，否则将进行**。两大工会会员约占全美11.5万铁路工人的一半（6万）。

外界预计，如果两大工会选择**，将使全美近30%的货运铁路系统陷入停顿，超过7000列火车将被闲置，每天的经济产出损失将高达20亿美元。

“工人因请假参加父母葬礼而受到处罚”

美国铁路工会和运营商之间的矛盾由来已久。在过去两年的谈判中，出勤政策和人员配备等待遇问题一直是争论的焦点。

工会方面表示，在经历行业长期的裁员增效后，全美铁路公司陷入严重的人员短缺困境。这导致铁路工人处于长期且高压的工作状态，需要每周7天随叫随到，在接到临时通知的情况下随时上班，有工人甚至因为请一天假去参加父母的葬礼而受到处罚：

铁路运营商自己导致的目前的劳工困境；

管理层大幅裁员以安抚股东并提高利润，最后倒霉的却是工人。

人员短缺背景下，铁路公司苛刻的考勤政策进一步加剧人员流失：在巴菲特重仓的铁路公司BNSF，超过700 名工会工人在公司建立基于积分的新考勤系统后选择辞职。

**将导致一场经济灾难

一场全国性的铁路**恐造成严重的冲击，加剧全美供应链和能源危机。

在供应链方面，全美大约40%的长途贸易是通过铁路运输的，比任何其他运输方式都多。任何持续的铁路**都会让正在缓慢复苏的供应链陷入瘫痪。

而在能源方面，美国绝大多数发电厂所需的煤炭燃料择是通过火车运输的。在冬季来临之际，煤炭运输中断将加剧能源市场的不确定性，对通胀预期造成负面影响。

美国农业生产也会受到波及，肥料研究所的首席执行官Corey Rosenbusch表示，化肥承运人需要在停运前做好准备，以确保货物供应安全可靠，这对即将施用秋季肥的农民来说是个坏消息。

美国商会认为，全国性铁路工人**将是一场经济灾难。为了避免对经济造成灾难性后果，工会应该与各公司达成协议，无限期地“冻结”局势，或者国会应该进行干预，强制解决冲突。

白宫已经努力，下面看国会

拜登政府已在今年7月已经介入**：工会**的企图被暂时阻止，劳资双方进入60天冷静期，白宫同时任命总统紧急事务委员会（PEB）来推动双方谈判。

在研究双方争议焦点后，PEB提议为11.5万名铁路工会成员加薪14%，并返还到2020年的欠薪。此外在2020年至2024年的五年合同期限内总共加薪24%。PEB的建议得到了12家工会中10家工会的初步同意，但SMART和BLET则以没有改善待遇条款拒绝该提议。

PEB已拒绝工会关于考勤等待遇方面的要求。劳资双方冷静期将于当地时间本周五凌晨00:01结束，美国总统没有权力再次阻止**，目前外界寄希望国会介入阻止**。

国会上一次干预铁路**还是在1992年。当时铁路机械师工会就新的劳动合同与CSX发生争执，在为期两天的**关闭全美铁路货运服务后，国会介入强制复工，阻止了危机进一步持续。</blockquote><blockquote>The top labor negotiator in talks to avert a railroad strike accused BNSF and Union Pacific

 of holding up progress.

Specifically, Dennis Pierce, president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, or BLET, said the companies rejected the union’s proposal for sick time policies.

“The primary resistance comes from Union Pacific and BNSF because of the attendance policies they have adopted which have treated workers so poorly,” Pierce told CNBC. “We’re just looking for time away from work to address our medical issues. Union Pacific and BNSF attendance policies are assessing (penalty) points to our members when they just want to take time off for their regular medical appointments.”

Attendance policies have been a point of contention for unions for years. The White House’s Presidential Emergency Board, or PEB, recommended any attendance policy disputes are best resolved in the grievance and arbitration process.

BNSF, which is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway

, flatly rejected Pierce’s claim, calling it “categorically false.”

“Rail employees are provided with significant time off. Generally, train crew employees have over three to four weeks of paid vacation and over 10 personal leave days. Depending on craft and seniority, these numbers can extend to five weeks of vacation in addition to 14 paid holidays and/or paid leave days,” BNSF told CNBC. “The number of Personal Leave Days was increased by 25% this year which makes it easier for employees to take time off.”

Union Pacific, meanwhile, said it “continues to push for a prompt resolution that provides historic wage increases to employees and allows the railroads to prevent further disruption to the struggling supply chain.”

Later, the company provided CNBC with another statement: “Union Pacific understands our employees want a different way and process, than the one that exists today, to request and receive time off for things like medical appointments. We are in active discussions with the unions to try to address these concerns.”

Pierce said the unions withdrew their proposal for paid sick leave and substituted their request for unpaid sick time. PEB recommendations suggested the unions withdraw their paid sick leave proposal based on the existing paid time off benefits given to employees.

Union negotiators offered the rail carriers a one-page, single-sided proposal to spare employees disciplinary points if they schedule routine medical visits in advance for days they would otherwise have to work, according to Pierce.

“You have to understand these workers are not on scheduled days. They have no scheduled days off. They work whenever they get called,” he said. “We are just asking for our workers to be able to go get their medical appointment done and not have to be at work that day.”

The Association of American Railroads, in turn, provided CNBC with its employee time off policy sheet.

“Ongoing negotiations are being collectively handled on a national, multi-employer basis,” a spokesman for the group said.

No backing down

Pierce praised some items in the PEB’s recommendations, but said it didn’t come through on quality of life issues.

“Life isn’t planned medical events aren’t planned. People need to be allowed to enjoy the fruits of their labor instead of just having to be at work every day,” he said. “So I think the key issue is this and there’s no way we can back away from it.”

Pierce said he has been in touch with members of President Joe Biden’s Cabinet. He told CNBC the unions do not intend to blink on the sick time argument.

“Strikes are a last resort. It does not help anyone because the employees lose money, and the companies lose money,” he said. “We’re not here to hurt the economy.”

Ripple effects from the labor strife are affecting other parts of the infrastructure. Starting Tuesday, Amtrak canceled some of its longer-distance rail services in anticipation of a service disruption.

Routes between Chicago and the West Coast along Amtrak’s Southwest Chief, California Zephyr, and Empire Builder are canceled. Portions of Amtrak’s Texas Eagle route between Los Angeles and San Antonio are also suspended. Amtrak is calling the cancelations a “phased adjustment” warning the disruptions could “significantly impact intercity rail service.”</blockquote>

 <blockquote>The White House has been preparing contingency plans to keep key goods moving and transportation lines open if union railroad workers strike later this week, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday.

“We are working with other modes of transportation including shippers, truckers and air freight to see how they can step in and keep goods moving in case of this rail shutdown,” Jean-Pierre said at a press briefing. “The administration has also been working with relevant agencies to assess what supply chains and commodities are most likely to face severe disruptions.”

President Joe Biden and several of Cabinet secretaries, including those representing the departments of Labor, Agriculture and Transportation, have been in talks for months with the unions and the companies to try to avert the strike, Jean-Pierre said. The administration, she added, has had hundreds of calls and meetings over the issue since the early spring.

“We have made crystal clear to the interested parties the harm that American families, businesses, farmers and communities would experience if they were not to reach a resolution,” Jean-Pierre said.

Union railroad workers have threatened to strike if their demands over pay and working conditions aren’t met. Negotiations are hung up on the issue of unpaid sick time, including the ability to take off work for routine doctor’s appointments.

More than 700 union workers quit after BNSF Railway, a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, instituted a points-based attendance system in February. Railroad companies say workers already have generous leave policies, but labor leaders argue that workers have trouble taking days off because they are not on a set schedule.

Eight of the 12 unions reached tentative agreements with the rail carriers as of Tuesday morning, according to the National Carriers’ Conference Committee, up from five a week ago.

But two of the largest unions, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the SMART Transportation Division, which combined represent half of railroad union workers, are still negotiating. That leaves about 60,000 workers ready to strike if a deal doesn’t happen by Friday.

“We encourage folks to stick at the negotiation table to come up with a resolution. This is important because of what this could mean to the American people, what this could mean to American families,” Jean-Pierre said.

About 40% of the nation’s long-distance trade is moved by rail. If the unions strike, more than 7,000 trains would be idled, costing up to an estimated $2 billion per day.

Already Americans have begun to feel the effects of a potential strike. Amtrak canceled some of its longer-distance rail services beginning Tuesday including routes between Chicago and the West Coast along Amtrak’s Southwest Chief, California Zephyr and Empire Builder lines, and portions of Amtrak’s Texas Eagle route between Los Angeles and San Antonio.</blockquote>
[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/14/ ... abor-secretary.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/14/railroad-strike-carriers-wont-lock-out-workers-negotiators-meet-with-labor-secretary.html)
 <blockquote>Negotiators from railroad carriers and unions met in Labor Secretary Marty Walsh’s office Wednesday as the sides tried to negotiate a deal ahead of Friday’s strike deadline.

The meeting started just after 9 a.m. ET. A spokesperson for the Labor Department said talks were ongoing as of midday. “The parties are negotiating in good faith and have committed to staying at the table today,” the representative said.

Walsh’s involvement comes as the Biden administration prepares for a work stoppage. A strike, which could affect about 60,000 workers and idle more than 7,000 trains, could cost the U.S. economy more than $2 billion a day. On Wednesday, Amtrak said it would cancel its long-distance train service starting Thursday since it operates nearly all of its route miles on freight railroads.

The railroads, for their part, “have no plans to lock out workers Friday should negotiations not be successfully completed,” the Association of American Railroads told CNBC.

Dennis Pierce, the unions’ top negotiator, said members have warned 10% of the workforce could leave if the issues aren’t resolved before the deadline. Sick time policies and quality of life concerns were the biggest sticking points remaining.

“<strong>Our proposal of no paid sick time costs them no money. It’s something they can manage. It doesn’t harm their business model,” said Pierce, who is the president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, or BLET. “The railroads need to start treating employees like humans, instead of imposing these policies that are just running people out of the industry.”</strong>

Eight of 12 railroad unions have reached tentative deals with companies as of earlier this week, but two of the biggest unions, BLET and the SMART Transportation Division are still talking to carriers. The two groups represent about half of union railroad workers. Earlier Wednesday, a smaller union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace workers voted against a deal.

The so-called cooling off period, which allowed both sides to continue negotiations, ends at midnight Friday, meaning a strike could happen in the early morning hours. In anticipation of a strike, the railroads have already started diverting freight.

Labor unions have begun distributing strike information to members in the event a deal can’t be reached by the deadline. A person familiar with the negotiations said the step is “normal procedure to get union workers ready for a strike.”

“This is not an indication a strike will indeed happen. This is a part of preparation procedures,” said the person, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the efforts.

In an email to members, the National Customs Brokers &amp; Forwarders Association of America listed the timeline of closures. CNBC has compiled a list of just some of the rail changes ahead of the deadline:

Wednesday: BNSF, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway

, stops moving refrigerated units into inland facilities

Wednesday: Norfolk Southern stops receiving exports

Thursday: CN stops receiving exports

Norfolk Southern

 and the other railroads have been ramping down freight in anticipation of a strike to move critical hazmat materials, such as chlorine and ethanol. This freight is taking priority over common freight.

But NS told CNBC it has altered some plans to accommodate more regular cargo.

“We continue to provide the most flexibility as we can for customers for as long as they can,” a spokesperson for the railroad told CNBC on Wednesday. “We have extended the period of time to accept trucks bringing containers into our land terminals until 5 pm tonight.”

Originally, NS intended to stop accepting containers Tuesday.

Recovering from the disruption created by a strike could take weeks, if not months, according to CNBC.

“Delivery of oversized transformers for transmission and distribution, natural gas turbines, and power generators, as well as renewable technology such as wind tower sections and blades, rely on the U.S. rail systems,” said Marco Poisler, COO of UTC Overseas, warning of “overwhelming delays” for deliveries.

“Transporting such cargo takes months of planning and rail engineering resources to identify available specialized rail assets with the right axle spread and deck height to achieve railroad clearance,” Poisler said.</blockquote>

发点钱让你滚蛋。核心的工时问题不会解决的。试想一下全年待机，随时去上班，不去或者迟到就可能被开除，请假会被扣分然后可能被开除。这可不是每小时工资加一块两块能替代的。咬下一块肉夸张了，最多算被刮了一点毛。

所以工会什么的，也就是意思一下让工人有个幻想罢了。

美国白宫表示，已经达成了一项暂定协议，以避免铁路停运的情况发生。一份来自总统拜登(Joe Biden)的声明称：“今晚达成的暂定协议对我们的经济和美国人民来说是一个重要胜利。”

拜登说，关键的铁路系统将继续运营，避免美国经济受到干扰。“这些铁路工人将获得更好的薪酬，改善的工作条件，以及令人安心的医疗健康费用：所有这些都来之不易。该协议对铁路公司来说也是一个胜利，它们将能够为这个在未来几十年仍将继续是美国经济支柱的行业留住并招募更多的工人。”

这个视频里还指出了中文互联网报道中普遍存在的一个误区“售票员”

货运铁路哪来TM的售票员

其实是对英语conductor的误译

这里的conductor 实际可以理解为列车员甚至是列车司机

 <blockquote>帮你们省流：美国雇员平均年收入84000，铁路人均130000，但代价就是24小时待命，每周工作60小时（24小时待命听到命令90分钟内要赶到工作现场的60小时）[吃瓜]</blockquote><blockquote>超长工作时间倒是还好，但工作坐牢+24小时待命+不能请假，这才是让人精神崩溃的主要原因。一般工作，工作坐牢的不会24小时待命，24小时待命的工作时间更自由，要么用工作时间坐牢换非工作时间彻底自由，要么用24小时待命换不用坐牢工作。美国这个又得坐牢又得24小时待命，就挺逆天的。</blockquote>
